      The Rolls-Royce Cullinan is a full-sized luxury sport utility vehicle
      (SUV) manufactured by Rolls-Royce Motor Cars as the brand's first
      all-wheel drive vehicle.[4] It is named after the Cullinan Diamond, the
      largest gem-quality rough diamond ever discovered.[4] The Cullinan sits
      above the Ghost and below the Phantom in Rolls-Royce's line,[5] with a
      starting price in the United States of approximately US$325,000
      (£255,000).[4][6] It was unveiled in May 2018 at the Concorso d'Eleganza
      Villa d'Este.[7] In the US, it is not exempt from the Energy Tax Act
      because it is classified as a station wagon rather than an SUV.

      n 2015 it was reported that a design was in the works and that the name
      would be Cullinan.[8] This was due to its competitors such as Bentley and
      Lamborghini venturing into the SUV business with the Bentayga and the Urus
      respectively. At the 2015 Frankfurt Auto Show, Rolls-Royce's CEO Torsten
      Müller-Ötvös said that the SUV will be revealed in 2018 and be on the
      market in 2019.[9] The name "Cullinan" was confirmed by Rolls-Royce on 13
      February 2018.[10][11] It is named after the Cullinan diamond, the largest
      diamond ever found at 3100 carats.[12] According to own Statement of BMW
      AG, Rolls-Royce and similar institutions, this generation of automobile
      with combustion engine has a preview to an end until 2030, due the company
      only producing electric models.[13] As of 2019 the British carmaker
      claimed that despite expanding production and hiring more employees, there
      simply wasn't enough supply to satisfy the demand fuelled by brand
      loyalist and new-found female, younger buyers.[14]
